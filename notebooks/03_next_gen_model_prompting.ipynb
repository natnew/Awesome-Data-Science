    "### Universal Prompting Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific**: Include context, constraints, and success criteria\n",
    "2. **Structure Requests**: Use numbered lists, sections, clear formatting\n",
    "3. **Provide Examples**: Few-shot learning improves quality significantly\n",
    "4. **Request Reasoning**: Ask models to \"think step-by-step\" for complex tasks\n",
    "5. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on output quality\n",
    "6. **Validate**: Always verify outputs, especially for critical decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science Specific Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Include Schema**: Always provide data structure and sample statistics\n",
    "2. **Define Success Metrics**: What does \"good\" look like?\n",
    "3. **Request Code**: Ask for implementation alongside analysis\n",
    "4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Explicitly mention potential pitfalls\n",
    "5. **Ask for Trade-offs**: Prompt for pros/cons of different approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Monitoring**: Track token usage, choose appropriate models\n",
    "2. **Latency Budget**: Use faster models when response time matters\n",
    "3. **Fallback Strategy**: Have backup models for availability\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Set up automated quality checks for outputs\n",
    "5. **Version Control**: Track prompt versions alongside code"
